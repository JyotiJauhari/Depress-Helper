# Depress Helper

*Depression is getting common now-a-days. So I have designed a website with chatbot and all necessary resources and a twitter bot that retweet the depressed tweet to bring it to people attention.*

## Inspiration :

The cases of depression is increasing now a days. So I thought of designing a twitter bot  and website with chatbot that will help depressed people .

## What it does :

There is a twitter bot named Depress_Helper which I made during this hackathon . It is designed using python libraries such that it automatically likes and retweets the depressed tweet. With this the professional volunteers can directly visit the bot profile and can contact and help depressed people.

Also there is a link of 'You are Fighter' on twitterbot profile which contains various sections with curated list of resources like songs, motivational videos, jokes, books and motivational quotes that will help depressed people to feel better.

There is a chatbot named 'YourFriendBot' that is programmed in a way to answer the questions the depressed person usually have.

## How I built it :

I have used twitter developer account to create the chatbot, and it is programmed using python and python libraries to retweet and like the depressed tweets. 

The website is built with html, css and hosted using GitHub pages. 

The chatbot is built with Google cloud, Dialogflow and twilio is used botcopy for improving the ui of chatbot

## Challenges I ran into :

Helping the depressed people by providing resources and a chat bot friend.
